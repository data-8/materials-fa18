He believed so strongly in the idea that he placed his household on a strict diet very low in saturated fats. The main difference between the Minnesota Coronary Experiment and the rest of the National Diet-Heart Study was the setting.

For example, the diet group's oils were replaced with corn oils and their butter was replaced with margarine. The subjects did not know which food they were getting, to avoid any potential bias or placebo effect. This type of study is known as a **blind** study.\n",
